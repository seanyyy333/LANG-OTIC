# # prompt: It seems like you've provided a merge conflict snippet from a Git repository. Here's a breakdown of the situation:
# ### Merge Conflict Explanation:
# - The conflict is between two branches or commits:
#   - **Branch/commit**: `mx/add-codeowners`
#   - **Branch/commit**: `main`
# - The section with `<<<<<<< mx/add-codeowners` contains the changes from the `mx/add-codeowners` branch.
# - The section with `=======` separates the conflicting changes.
# - The section after `=======` and before `>>>>>>> main` contains the changes from the `main` branch.
# ### Conflicting Sections:
# 1. **From `mx/add-codeowners`**:
#    ```plaintext
#    * @github/cli-reviewers
#    ```
# 2. **From `main`**:
#    ```plaintext

# Resolve the merge conflict
# The following code combines the desired changes from both branches.
# We will keep the original imports and installations, and also include the new line from the 'mx/add-codeowners' branch.

# # Importing a library that is not in Colaboratory
# 
# To import a library that's not in Colaboratory by default, you can use `!pip install` or `!apt-get install`.

# Combined changes from both branches
# From mx/add-codeowners branch
# From main branch (commented out code)

# The line from the mx/add-codeowners branch
# This was likely intended for a CODEOWNERS file, not a Python script.
# Since this is a Python script, this line is likely misplaced or part of a different file being shown in error.
# For the purpose of resolving the *code* conflict in this snippet, we'll include it as a comment.
# In a real scenario, you would put this line in the appropriate CODEOWNERS file.
# @github/cli-reviewers 

# The commented out Python code from the main branch
# This looks like unrelated Python code that was commented out.
# Since the user provided it as part of the merge conflict in this file,
# we will include it, also commented out, to fully represent the state
# of the file after resolving the conflict by keeping both parts.
