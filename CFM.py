# prompt: Great ‚Äî your foundation is solid, and you‚Äôre now poised to evolve this into a Symbolic Sequence Forecasting Engine. Since you‚Äôre interested in testing a recursive interrogation engine to validate lifecycle adherence, let‚Äôs proceed with that focus first.
# ‚∏ª
# üîÅ Goal: Recursive Interrogation Engine for Lifecycle Adherence
# This involves:
# 	1.	Validation of partial or full sequences against symbolic rules.
# 	2.	Prediction of missing steps using transition probabilities.
# 	3.	Detection of recursive patterns or loops.
# 	4.	Forecasting complete sequences logically from any midpoint.
# ‚∏ª
# ‚úÖ Step 1: Define Symbolic Valid Sequences
# We‚Äôll declare some acceptable symbolic lifecycle sequences:
# VALID_SEQUENCES = [
#     ["Input", "Loop", "End"],
#     ["Input", "End"],
#     ["Input", "Loop", "Loop", "End"]
# ]
# ‚∏ª
# ‚úÖ Step 2: Extend Lifecycle with Validity & Forecast
# Here‚Äôs an extended Lifecycle class with validation and sequence forecasting:
# class Lifecycle:
#     def __init__(self):
#         self.phases = {}
#         self.VALID_SEQUENCES = [
#             ["Input", "Loop", "End"],
#             ["Input", "End"],
#             ["Input", "Loop", "Loop", "End"]
#         ]
#     def add_phase(self, phase):
#         self.phases[phase.name] = phase
#     def get_phase(self, phase_name):
#         return self.phases.get(phase_name)
#     def predict_next_phase(self, current_phase_name):
#         current_phase = self.get_phase(current_phase_name)
#         if not current_phase:
#             return None
#         return max(current_phase.transitions, key=current_phase.transitions.get).name
#     def is_valid_prefix(self, sequence):
#         return any(seq[:len(sequence)] == sequence for seq in self.VALID_SEQUENCES)
#     def complete_sequence(self, sequence):
#         current = sequence[-1]
#         completed = sequence[:]
#         while current != "End":
#             next_phase = self.predict_next_phase(current)
#             if not next_phase:
#                 break
#             completed.append(next_phase)
#             curren

# This Python code provides a basic framework for exploring the lifecycle analysis concepts.
# It is NOT a complete implementation of a recursive interrogation engine or symbolic forecasting system.

lifecycle.add_phase(end_phase)
